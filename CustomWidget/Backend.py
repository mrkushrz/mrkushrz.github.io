However, forecasts of higher production in Brazil in 2023-24 are expected to offset some of these declines. Despite the surplus, analysts expect sugar prices to remain elevated but not necessarily at current six- or seven-year highs. Thailand is expected to increase sugar production, but the current production outlook is viewed more as a bounce back rather than a trend upwards. A mild winter followed by extremely hot and dry summer conditions created a stressful environment for the European Union's crop, and the situation was further exacerbated by a scourge of beet yellow virus, likely linked to the EU‚Äôs recent ban on neonicotinoid insecticides, which have been blamed for killing bees.

The May white-sugar contract is set to expire on Friday, and large open interest signals that some traders without physical supplies may need to close out short positions, supporting prices. The recent rally has pushed futures markets into overbought territory and may add to costs for manufacturers of everything from fizzy drinks to baked goods and maintain pressure on global food inflation.\\n\\nKeywords: Sugar prices, New York, tight global supplies, limited exports, India, world shortage, May white-sugar contract, overbought territory, global food inflation.\\n', 'Summary: Sugar prices in India have increased by more than 6% in two weeks due to falling production levels in Maharashtra, the top sugar producing state in the country. This is likely to strengthen demand from bulk consumers during the peak summer season and could lead to further price increases.

Additionally, people are eating far too much red and processed meats such as bacon, sausage, salami and the like. Those three factors were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018. Researchers found that over 60% of diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. Low intake of fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and yogurt was responsible for just over 39% of the new cases. People in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet, while Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases. \\n\\nKeywords: refined grains, whole grains, red meat, processed meat, type 2 diabetes, diet, sugar-sweetened beverages, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, yogurt, epidemiology.\\n', \"Summary: The United Nations‚Äô food agency's world price index fell for the 12th consecutive month, dropping to its lowest level since last July due to ample supplies and subdued import demand.

The FAO raised its forecast for world wheat production in 2023, which is now pegged at 786 million tonnes and cereal stocks are expected to ease by 0.3% from their opening levels to 850 million tonnes.
